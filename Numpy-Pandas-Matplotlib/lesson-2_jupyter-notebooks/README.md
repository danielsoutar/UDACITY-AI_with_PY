This is a Jupyter notebook: 'Working with code cells.ipynb'.

I downloaded the notebook as HTML, to create 'Working with code cells.html'.

>  "You'll often want to download it as an HTML file to share with others who aren't using Jupyter. Also, you can download the notebook as a normal Python file where all the code will run like normal."" - [Udacity: Notebook Interface](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd089/parts/8de94dee-7635-43b3-9d11-5e4583f22ce3/modules/dd3e4af8-d576-427e-baae-925fd16ff2ff/lessons/13f4b7d6-92a9-468d-9008-084fc8b53a23/concepts/0d3b93d8-fd93-4dde-92f2-55594d6d458e#)
