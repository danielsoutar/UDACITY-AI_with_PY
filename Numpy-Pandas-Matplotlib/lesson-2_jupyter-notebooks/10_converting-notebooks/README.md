I'm going to run the command to convert __Working with code cells.ipynb__ from _06_code-cells/_ to an html file.

From this _10_converting-notebooks/_ directory, I ran `jupyter nbconvert --to html ../06_code-cells/working-with-code-cells.ipynb
`. It allowed me to convert, but it did not allow me to specify directory location of output.

I had to move the converted html file from _06_code-cells/_ to this directory (_10_converting-notebooks/_).
