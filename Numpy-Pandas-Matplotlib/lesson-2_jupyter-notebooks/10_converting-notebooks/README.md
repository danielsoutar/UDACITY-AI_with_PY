I'm going to run the command to convert _Working with code cells.ipynb_ from __06_code-cells/__ to an html file: _working-with-code-cells.html_.

From this __10_converting-notebooks/__ directory, I ran `jupyter nbconvert --to html ../06_code-cells/working-with-code-cells.ipynb
`. It allowed me to convert, but it did not allow me to specify directory location of output.

I had to move the converted html file from __06_code-cells/__ to this directory (__10_converting-notebooks/__).
